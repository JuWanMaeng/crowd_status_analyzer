The dataset includes 3283 images.
Faces are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 25 percent of the image
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1 pixels
